TLiDB is the main folder holding the benchmark
examples contains sample code for training models
distances contains code for calculating distances between datasets/domains/tasks
dataset_preprocessing is for reproducability purposes, not required for end users. It contains scripts used to preprocess the TLiDB datasets from their original form into the TLiDB form
